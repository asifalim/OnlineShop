<h3>ADMIN PART</h3>
In Admin section, Admin can add producttypes(i.e mobile, laptop, television) and can delete as per need. Admin can also add new products(i.e iphone 6s, hp laptop etc.) as per producttypes. Here I used dropdown list to show available producttypes that retrieve stored producttypes from database. Also, a _buttonPartial class is implemented so that when I need to to perform action related to edit, details and delete I can call it easily and this will enhance code reusability. I make to text boxes left one is for lowamount and right one is for highamount to filter all the product whose price in between them. I used datatable jquery by adding cdn link and stylesheet from internet for different types of services like sorting product based on field and save the products data in pdf, csv etc. Admin can also assign a user with some role for efficient management. A user when registered, he/she will be assigned with customer role by default but admin can update his/her role or can lockout them for a fixed amout of time or can permanently delete his/her information.

<h3>CUSTOMER PART</h3>
In Customer section, a new customer can access the website with login or without login. Customer cann't see the some feature related to producttypes, products etc. Customer can see the details of products and can add it to cart for further proccessing. When his/her shopping is completed then they can pre order the selected products by giving their personal information.
They can order a product only if that product is available by checking it.
